Scala RSS
=========

A very simple RSS reader written in Scala. As of now, it prints the entire item as is instead of formatting the text a special way or showing an image.

Usage
-----

Run the program via sbt in the root folder. You will be asked to input an RSS feed link. If nothing is provided, or an error occured with the link it defaults to [an RSS example link](http://static.userland.com/gems/backend/rssTwoExample2.xml) provided at the [RSS 2.0 specification](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html). The reader assumes that the RSS link provided conforms to the RSS 2.0 specification.

If you have any comments or criticisms please tell me!
